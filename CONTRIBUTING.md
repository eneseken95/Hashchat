### Reporting Bugs

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/bahattinyunus/Hashchat/issues/new). (Since we can't be sure you want your own user link here, I'll use a generic placeholder or the repo owner's link if known. Assuming repo owner for now).
- Provide as much context as possible.
- Describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue.
